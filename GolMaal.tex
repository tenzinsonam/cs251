\maketitle

Hrishikesh Mukherjee directs another comedy movie involving simple middle-class people and presents it through their everyday struggle. The picture is simple, authentic and fun. The concept of a young guy who would go to any extent to not lose his job is very interesting, and Mukherjee handles it hilariously. It gets funnier and funnier as it goes along. As the conflict gets more complicated, the obstacles are doubled, and the irony grows.\\

However, the movie also has soul, and that's one of its high-points. The characters are colourful and memorable, but they also have depth which makes them easy to identify with. The relationships are impressively portrayed and it's nice to see united families and relatives and how they care for each other and help each other in times of need.

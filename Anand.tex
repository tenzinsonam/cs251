What an outstanding movie! I have heard all the prior generation people rave about this movie. So, I decided to check this movie out. I only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this in the theater.\\

The other reason why I decided to check this out was a Super-bowl half-time debate on whether Amitabh was better than Rajesh Khanna. I could not appreciate the argument that Amitabh, being more junior, has not equaled Rajesh, because he has done his share very well. In fact, it was only because of the exceptional preformances given by both the stalwart actors, that 'Anand' acclaimed a cult status among movies. Thus, even after watching this movie, the debate stands frozen.\\

However, in the process of arguing one of the actors to the top, some important aspects of 'Anand' are being ignored. The story, the script, the screenplay and amazing direction have made this movie come alive like real. This movie is a perfect concoction of emotions, drama, tragedy and comedy. It was able to strike a chord with every member of the audience, young or old, boy or girl. Thus, garnering immense love and applause from all its viewers.\\

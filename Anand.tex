What an outstanding movie!! I have heard all the prior generation people rave about this movie, so, I decided to check this movie out myself. I only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this
in the theater. The other reason why I decided to check this out was a Super-bowl half-time debate on whether Amitabh was better

than Rajesh Khanna. I could not participate in  Amitabh, being more junior, has not equaled Rajesh, but has done his share very well. Thus, even after watching this movie, the debate will continue \par
